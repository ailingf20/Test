function betabar = rhobar2betabar(rhobar)
% function betabar = rhobar2betabar(rhobar);
%
% Function to take in a sample rank correlation matrix and return a vector of implied loadings on the common factor
% (assuming a simple one-factor structure for the data).
%
% NOTE: This function maps the sample rank correlation to the model-implied *linear* correlation (which has a nice closed-form expression). The difference
% between rank and linear correlation is small for rho inside about [-0.75,0.75]. For rho above 0.8 or so we find rank correlation is below linear
% correlation, which leads to estimated betabar being below the true beta. So be wary applying this function to highly correlated series.
%
%  INPUTS:  rhobar, a NxN matrix, the sample rank correlation matrix
%
%  OUTPUTS: betabar, a Nx1 vector, the estimated implied loadings on the common factor
