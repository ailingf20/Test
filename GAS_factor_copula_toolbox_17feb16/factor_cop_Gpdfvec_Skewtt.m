%         Gpdf,     a matrix of the marginal pdfs of skew t-t factor model at x and factor loading (lam)
%         x_grid,   a vector of x that Gpdf is evaluated at
%         lam_grid, a vector of factor loading that Gpdf is evaluated at
%
%  OUTPUTS: out, a vector, the marginal pdfs approximated at q
